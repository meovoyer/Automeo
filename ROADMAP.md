Automeo Roadmap:
================
Reasons for choosing java as the programming language:
	Java is used because it is an easy language to learn and has several well-documented libraries.
	Java is also a good language to learn for future employment.
	I am familiar with the Eclipse IDE for java.
	Git is well integrated to the Eclipse IDE and GitHub will be simpler to use as an online repository.
	Java works on Windows, MacOS and Linux distributions.
